# Sharpe Ratio Analysis for Amazon and Facebook Stocks

## Introduction

In the world of finance, comparing different investments requires considering not only the expected returns but also the associated risks. One widely used metric for this purpose is the Sharpe Ratio, introduced by Professor William Sharpe in 1966. The Sharpe Ratio measures the additional return per unit of risk an investor could obtain by choosing one investment over another. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more favourable risk-return profile.

In this analysis, we'll calculate the Sharpe Ratio for two tech giants, Amazon and Facebook, using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The Sharpe Ratio is typically calculated for a portfolio, but for simplicity, we'll use individual stocks and a stock index as a benchmark.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed before running the Jupyter Notebook:

- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- ```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd your repository

- Open the Jupyter Notebook: sharpe_ratio_analysis.ipynb
- Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis.

## Usage

The notebook covers the following key steps:

- Importing required modules and setting up the environment.

- Calculating daily returns for the S&P 500 benchmark.
- Calculating excess returns for Amazon and Facebook compared to the S&P 500.
- Computing the Sharpe Ratio, including the average difference in daily returns and the standard deviation of the return difference.
- Visualizing and interpreting the results.
